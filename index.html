    <h1>Introduction to Programming in Python For Beginners</h1>
    <h2>Course Information</h2>
    <p>Welcome to "An Introduction to Programming With Python"! In this course, I will be taking you through all the basics of Python and programming in general, in this 3 week course. I will be teaching you how to use simple Python techniques and understanding the basic fundamentals and concepts. More importantly, I will be teaching you the logic behind understanding programming, understanding patterns and learning not only how to use them to solve problems in code, but solve problems in real life. Before you start, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">click here</a> to downlod Sublime Text, which you will be using to code. Once you download Sublime, save all Python files with a .py extention. Hopefully, throughout this course, you will be able to learn something new, and that you will be equipped with some essential skills for the rest of your life. Happy coding!</p>
    <a href="python-uses-w1.html" class="buttons">Week 1: An Introduction To Python</a>
    <p>This week is our introductory week. Here, we will be starting our Python journey together. I will be talking first about programming and the realm of software and computing in general, and then I will be moving on into some basic principles of programming in general, by coding it in Python. These topics are fundamental to all of Python, so it is crucial that you pay attention nd absorb every piece of information discussed here. So far, we've gotten to Python Variables, but we will be constantly updating. Happy coding!</p>
